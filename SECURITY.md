# Security Policy

## Overview

GameGen-X prioritizes security across all system components, implementing comprehensive security measures for FreeBSD-based deployments, AI model protection, and real-time system safeguards.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Support Status | End of Support |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| 1.x     | Full Support  | Dec 31, 2024  |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Bug Bounty Program
We partner with HackerOne for our bug bounty program. Visit our HackerOne page to submit vulnerabilities and earn rewards.

### Direct Reporting
For critical security issues, contact us directly at security@gamegen-x.com. Please encrypt sensitive information using our [PGP key].

### Response Timeline
We adhere to the following Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for vulnerability responses:

| Severity | Initial Response | Target Resolution |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Critical | 24 hours        | 48 hours         |
| High     | 48 hours        | 5 days           |
| Medium   | 7 days          | 30 days          |
| Low      | 30 days        | 90 days          |

## Security Best Practices

### FreeBSD Hardening
- Implement mandatory access controls (MAC)
- Enable secure level 2 in kernel
- Configure service-specific jails
- Regular security audit using auditd
- Minimal network services exposure

### AI Model Security
- Strict input validation for all model inputs
- Output sanitization for generated content
- Rate limiting on model inference
- Model weight encryption at rest
- Access control for model operations

### Real-time System Protection
- Real-time threat detection
- Automated incident response
- Continuous security monitoring
- Regular penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication using RS256 signing
- 1-hour token expiry
- Secure token storage requirements
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management controls

### Authorization
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation:

| Role      | Permissions |
|-----------|-------------|
| Admin     | Full system access, security configuration |
| Developer | API access, model interaction |
| User      | Basic application usage |

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Secure key management using HSM
- Regular encryption key rotation
- Forward secrecy enabled

### Data Classification
| Type | Protection Level | Controls |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Model Weights | High | Encryption, Access Control |
| User Data | High | Encryption, Anonymization |
| Generated Content | Medium | Access Control |
| System Logs | Medium | Retention Policy |

## Compliance

### Standards Compliance
- OWASP Top 10 (2021) - Compliant
- GDPR - Compliant
- SOC 2 Type II - In Progress
- ISO 27001 - Planned Q4 2024

### Security Monitoring
- Weekly vulnerability scanning
- Quarterly security audits
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Regular penetration testing
- Automated security reporting

## Incident Response

### Response Process
1. Detection & Analysis
2. Containment
3. Eradication
4. Recovery
5. Post-Incident Analysis

### Severity Levels
| Level | Description | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Critical | System compromise, data breach | Immediate |
| High | Service disruption, potential breach | <48 hours |
| Medium | Limited impact, no data exposure | <7 days |
| Low | Minor issues, no service impact | <30 days |
